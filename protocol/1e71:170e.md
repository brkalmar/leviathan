# NZXT CPU cooler 1e71:170e reverse-engineered USB 2.0 protocol

The device has 1 configuration, 1 interface, and 1 alternative setting.  The interface has the default CONTROL IN/OUT endpoint `0x00`, an INTERRUPT OUT endpoint `0x01`, and an INTERRUPT IN endpoint `0x81`.

The protocol allows

- monitoring of
  - the fan speed
  - the pump speed
  - the liquid temperature
- setting
  - the fan speed
  - the pump speed
  - the NZXT logo LED
  - the 8 LEDs in the ring

# Initialization

The device is initialized via a CONTROL message with the following constant setup request data:

Bytes | Field | Meaning 
------|-------|--------
`0x80` | request type | device in
`0x06` | request | GET DESCRIPTOR standard request
`0x0303` | value | descriptor type and descriptor index
`0x0409` | index | language id `en-US`
`0x0082` | length | descriptor length 130

The device then responds with its serial number as the descriptor:

Byte | Meaning
-----|--------
1 | total data length *L*
2 | `0x03` constant (type of data is string)
3-*L* | ((*L* - 2) / 2)-digit serial number, encoded as little-endian UTF-16 string

For example, the following is sent if the serial number is `0123456789A`:

    0x24 0x03 0x30 0x00 0x31 0x00 0x32 0x00 0x33 0x00 0x34 0x00 0x35 0x00 0x36 0x00 0x37 0x00 0x38 0x00 0x39 0x00 0x41 0x00

# Monitoring

A status update is requested via an INTERRUPT request of at least 17 bytes on endpoint `0x81`.  The device then responds with the following data:

Byte | Meaning
-----|--------
1 | `0x04` ??? (constant)
2 | liquid temperature [°C]
3 | ??? (not constant)
4-5 | fan speed [rpm]
6-7 | pump speed [rpm]
8-17 | `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x78 0x02 0x00 0x01 0x08 0x1e 0x00` ??? (appears to be constant)

# Setting

A set directive is sent via an INTERRUPT message on endpoint `0x01`.  The initial byte is always `0x02`.  The 2nd byte decides what to set:

Byte | Sets
-----|-----
`0x4d` | fan/pump speed
`0x4c` | leds

The 3rd byte's meaning depends on the 2nd byte.

## Fan/pump speed

Byte | Meaning
-----|--------
3-4 | set speed of what
5 | speed [% of max speed]

Bytes 3-4 have the following valid values:

Bytes | Sets
------|-----
`0x00 0x00` | fan
`0x40 0x00` | pump

For example, the following sets the pump to 75%:

    0x02 0x4d 0x40 0x00 0x4b

## LEDs

For presets that cycle, an INTERRUPT message is sent for each cycles.

Colors are represented as 3-byte sequences, red-green-blue for the circle LEDs, and green-red-blue (**NB**!) for the NZXT logo LED.

Byte | Meaning
-----|--------
3 | direction & moving & led byte
4 | preset
5 | cycle & group size & interval byte
6-8 | nzxt logo led color (GRB **NB**)
9-11 | circle led 1 color (RGB)
12-14 | circle led 2 color (RGB)
15-17 | circle led 3 color (RGB)
18-20 | circle led 4 color (RGB)
21-23 | circle led 5 color (RGB)
24-26 | circle led 6 color (RGB)
27-29 | circle led 7 color (RGB)
30-32 | circle led 8 color (RGB)

### Byte 3

Has the following structure (most significant bit first):

Bit | Meaning
----|--------
1-4 | direction (only meaningful for some presets)
5 | moving (only meaningful for some presets)
6-8 | which leds to set

#### Direction

Sets the direction of movement of the light.  It can be:

Value | Meaning
------|--------
`0b0000` | "forward" (clockwise)
`0b0001` | "backward" (counter-clockwise)

#### Moving

Only meaningful for preset "alternating".  It decides wether to move the colors in a circle (value `1`) or just switch back-and-forth between them (value `0`).

#### Which LEDs to set

Value | Meaning
------|--------
`0b0001` | logo led
`0b0010` | ring leds

### Byte 4

Byte | Preset
-----|-------
`0x00` | "fixed"
`0x01` | "fading"
`0x02` | "spectrum wave"
`0x03` | "marquee"
`0x04` | "covering marquee"
`0x05` | "alternating"
`0x06` | "breathing"
`0x07` | "pulse"
`0x08` | "tai chi"
`0x09` | "water cooler"

### Byte 5

Has the following structure (most significant bit first):

Bit | Meaning
----|--------
1-3 | cycle number (only meaningful for some presets)
4-5 | group size (only meaningful for some presets)
6-8 | interval (only meaningful for some presets)

#### Cycle number

Used for dynamic presets.  Up to 8 cycles are permitted.  Cycle number *n* says that the colors are to be set for cycle *n*, where 0 ≤ *n* ≤ 8.

#### Group size

Only meaningful for preset "marquee".  It decides how many leds of the circle are on at the same time, i.e. how long of an arc the light covers.  Group size *n* says that *n* + 3 consecutive LEDs (**NB** not *n*) shall be on at the same time, where 0 ≤ *n* ≤ 3.

#### Interval

Determines how long the cycle determined by cycle number is:

Value | Meaning
------|--------
`0b000` | slowest
`0b001` | slower
`0b010` | normal
`0b011` | faster
`0b100` | fastest

### Colors

The rest of the bytes contains the color(s) to set.  When the NZXT logo's color is to be set, it is in byte 6-8 as a GRB 3-tuple.  When the ring LEDs are to be set, the colors are in bytes 9-32 as a sequence of 8 RGB 3-tuples.

LEDs 1-8 in the sequence are physically laid out in the following fashion in the device:

      8 1
    7     2
    6     3
      5 4

### Compatiblities

The following table documents which fields are meaningful for which presets, and how many cycles should be sent for each preset.  Fields that are not meaningful for a given preset should be zeroed out (or in the case of Interval should be set to `2`).

Preset | Direction | Moving | Cycle number | Required cycles | Group Size | Interval
-------|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------
fixed | no | no | no | 1 | no | no
fading | no | no | yes | 1-8 | no | yes
spectrum wave | yes | no | no | 1 | no | yes
marquee | yes | no | no | 1 | yes | yes
covering marquee | yes | no | yes | 1-8 | no | yes
alternating | no | yes | yes | 2 | no | yes
breathing | no | no | yes | 1-8 | no | yes
pulse | no | no | yes | 1-8 | no | yes
tai chi | no | no | yes | 2 | no | yes
water cooler | no | no | no | 1 | no | yes
